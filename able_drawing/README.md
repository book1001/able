# FlowSharpWeb
Build a Prototype Web-Based Diagramming App with SVG and Javascript

![Screenshot](article/screenshot1.png?raw=true "Screenshot")

This is an early prototype intended to be a learning excerise for how to create a web-based diagramming tool.
At this stage, learning about how to use SVG dynamically is explored:

* create a virtual surface
* drop shapes onto the surface
* move shapes around
* resize shapes
* connect shapes with simple lines

The full article describing the implementation will be posted on CodeProject shortly.

A JSFiddle of the code base published in the article is here: https://jsfiddle.net/cliftonm/o2ve65c9/
