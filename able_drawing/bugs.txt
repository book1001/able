Dragging the toolbox surface causes an offset in the location of a toolbox shape when the shape drag & drop is initiated.

Circle shouldn't have an empty edit box in the property grid in the second column after the radius.
	Same with Text

FIXED:Dragging text shape doesn't work!
	Issue was that the onPropertyChanged event call in textView.js was using the old style call rather than a dictionary format for parameters.

Dragging shape from toolbox needs to immediately wire up the property grid.

Properties for shapes that are paths, like diamonds.

// ========================================

Sometimes an anchor (or two) disappears in when sizing the rectangle.

-width & -height results in no rectangle appearing.

keyboard l/r/u/d movement sort of works, until shape leaves mouse area and connection points appear in the wrong place after moving a line, so
there's all sorts of weird side effects going on.

==========================

scrolling surface quickly which causes the mouse to go over an element fires the surface leave event which stops scrolling.

create circles within circles.  Since the mouse leave doesn't fire for a particular circle, we only get the anchor points for the outer circle.
Related: If you place a text shape inside another shape and try to move the text shape, the anchors of the outer shape move with the text!

Why do I get "a is not defined" when I move parseTransform into helpers?

Negative width/height for diamond shape doesn't render path correctly.  Should prevent changing shape when width/height is negative.

fixed: moving a shape quickly on the surface messes up the anchor translation
fixed: multiple loads doesn't work (the file is already loaded, so it does nothing)
fixed: double event trigger on mouse down on shape after load (but only 2, never more)
fixed: shapes (even new ones dropped) can't be dragged after load
fixed: after load, scrolling surface translates surface but not objects on surface
fixed: inspect the svg element, why is the width and height so large?  string/int concat issue?
